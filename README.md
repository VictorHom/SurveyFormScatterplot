SurveyFormScatterplot
=====================

fill out the form. submit. the scatterplot is updated.
I worked on xampp for 2 reasons.
//1. it to work with d3
//2. the php would work properly. the php files had issues 
finding files using the simple python server. 
look at the ajax to tweak where
your files are located.
